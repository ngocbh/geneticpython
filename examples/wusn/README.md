# Optimal relay nodes placement for wireless single and multi-hop sensor networks

## Requirements

It requires `python 3.6+` and `pip3`.

Install requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements
```

## Run experiments

Change parameters in `parameters.py`:

```
SH_MODEL = "0.0.1" // "0.0.1" for run experimental arguments and "test" for testing
MH_MODEL = "0.0.1" // "0.0.1" for run experimental arguments and "test" for testing
```

Because the experiments run very slow, Do test environments by using "test" parameters at first.

```
python run.py
```
