Here is a footnote reference[^1] and another.[^longnote]
Here is an inline note.^[Inlines notes are easier to
write, since you don't have to pick an identifier and
move down to type the note.]
  
[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.
  
    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.
